### Data compression

Consider compressing the JSON data. Uncompressed data is about 1.2TB as of October 20th.

Eugene Luzgin - EOS Tribe:

Regarding fast compression:
Few years ago I was working for an aircraft technical publishing company,
where they published gigabytes of technical documentation in database.
After evaluating many compressions algorithms - we picked LZ4 compression for speed:
https://lz4.github.io/lz4/

"LZ4 is lossless compression algorithm, providing compression speed at 400 MB/s per core (0.16 Bytes/cycle). It features an extremely fast decoder, with speed in multiple GB/s per core (0.71 Bytes/cycle). A high compression derivative, called LZ4_HC, is available, trading customizable CPU time for compression ratio. LZ4 library is provided as open source software using a BSD license."


### Project name

Need to set up a voting for the project name. Candidate list:

* Wenchang
* brixly
* digitalpast
* spydo
